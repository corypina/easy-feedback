## Easy Feedback
**Easy Feedback** adds a feedback form to the bottom of every page on your site. It requests user feedback about issues with the current page.

**The form asks for three things from the user:**

- What the user was doing
- What went wrong
- Their email address (optional)

The form appears only on the `pages` post-type, and does _not_ appear on archive pages.

## Customizations

**These elements are customizable via the menu at `Settings > Easy Feedback`:**

- The link text for toggling the form's visibility
- The form's headline
- The form's description
- The email address that receives form submissions

The form is styled very minimally so that it (hopefully) blends in with your active theme. There are, however, several classes and IDs baked into the form, which you can target with custom CSS.

### Defaults

- **Link to toggle form:** _Something wrong with this page?_
- **Form Headline:** _Help us improve_
- **Form description:** _Thanks for helping us improve the site. Is there a typo? Something broken? Didn't find something where you expected to? Let us know. We'll use your feedback to improve this page, and the site overall._
- **Email Address:** The site's admin email

## Acknowledgements

The default form language was inspired by the fine folks who run the web at [California State University Monterey Bay](http://csumb.edu), who were in turn inspired by the [government of the United Kingdom](http://gov.uk).
